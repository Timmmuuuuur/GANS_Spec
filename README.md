VERY IMPORTANT TO READ!
If you cannot see the .ipynb notebooks from github try pasting the link to the notebook into
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
YOU DO NOT NEED TO DOWNLOAD ANYTHING - just paste the URL of the notebook into the search bar.


This happens due to the change in the UI/UX of Coursera that led to the removal of the functionality that allowed the downloads of the entire course content so now it's just separate notebooks that I've completed.
